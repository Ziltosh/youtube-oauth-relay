# Notes for Coolify deployment:
# 1. Create a new service pointing to this repository
# 2. Set the domain to your desired subdomain (e.g., oauth.yourdomain.com)
# 3. Enable HTTPS (Let's Encrypt will be auto-configured)
# 4. Deploy - that's it!
#
# The relay service will be available at https://oauth.yourdomain.com
